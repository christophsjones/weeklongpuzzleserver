<p>The path to Derpy is twisted, and to get there you must solve a series of puzzles.</p>

<p>The puzzles can be extremely varied, but they will all share a few common threads:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each puzzle has a one or two word English answer. When you determine what the answer is, you should know that you have it.</li>
    <li>How to extract the answer is not conveyed in any explicit instructions. That being said, each puzzle is designed so that obtaining the answer follows naturally from the components of the puzzle. Finding out how to obtain the answer and carrying out that process is the crux of the puzzle.</li>
    <li>There are some components that can help put you on the right path towards a solve. Puzzles have titles, which often convey a hint. Some puzzles also have one or more sentences that cryptically clue you towards a solve. This often goes by the name <i>flavor text</i>.</li>
    <li>You will never have to anagram letters. Remember that puzzle answers are unique! If the method you use could lead to many different answers, it may not be correct.</li>
    <li>Finally, listen to your teammates. You will almost certainly be required to think creatively and outside of the box, and even an idea you think won't work may lead to an answer.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the hunt, to determine Derpy's final location, you must solve the metapuzzle. The metapuzzle will be released on Thursday, and it will require you to have solved most or all of the prior puzzles. Exactly how the prior puzzles tie in to the metapuzzle is up to you to determine.</p>
