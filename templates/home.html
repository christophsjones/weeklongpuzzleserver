<p>Welcome to SCS Puzzlehunt 2016!</p>

<p>Where did Derpy the Dragon go? Solve puzzles to find out!</p>

<p>For the first time ever SCS Day will be accompanied by a weeklong puzzlehunt. Starting on February 22, two puzzles will be released per day at noon on each of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. On Thursday we will also release a metapuzzle. Solve the metapuzzle to finish the puzzlehunt! </p>

<p>Register your team of up to 4 in the "Register" section. If you've already done that, we suggest having a look at the "Puzzlehunt Guide" section.</p>

<p>See you Monday!</p>
